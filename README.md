## The Problem: Digital Clutter on macOS

Every Mac user has experienced it — that dreaded "Your disk is almost full" notification. Over time, our Macs accumulate thousands of files: old downloads, forgotten documents, duplicate photos, and archived projects. Manually identifying what's safe to delete is time-consuming and risky. We needed a smarter solution.

**CleanMac** was born from this frustration. We set out to build a native macOS application that could intelligently scan user directories, identify unused files based on actual usage patterns, and safely remove them with a single click.

## The Vision: Smart, Safe, and User-Friendly

Our goal was ambitious but clear: create a macOS-focused Python application with a native GUI that could scan user storage (excluding system files and apps) for files not opened recently, then bulk-delete them safely.

### Core Requirements
- **Smart Discovery**: Use macOS Spotlight metadata to identify file usage patterns
- **Safety First**: Never touch system files, app bundles, or Photos library internals
- **User Control**: Granular filtering by file type, age, and size
- **Native Experience**: PySide6-based GUI that feels like a native macOS app
- **Reversible Actions**: All deletions go to Trash with undo support

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture: Leveraging macOS Native APIs

CleanMac is built using modern Python with deep integration into macOS system APIs for optimal performance and safety.

### The Scanning Engine: Spotlight Integration

The heart of CleanMac is its intelligent file discovery system, built around macOS's Spotlight search technology. Instead of crawling the filesystem (which would be slow and resource-intensive), we leverage `mdfind` to query Spotlight's indexed metadata.

```python
def spotlight_discover(root: Path, stop_event: threading.Event) -> Iterable[Path]:
    # Include images, videos, archives, and common document types
    query = (
        "(kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.image\" || "
        "kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.movie\" || "
        "kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.archive\" || "
        "kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"com.adobe.pdf\" || "
        "kMDItemContentTypeTree == \"public.content\")"
    )
    
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["mdfind", "-onlyin", str(root), query],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
        text=True,
    )
    
    for line in proc.stdout:
        if stop_event.is_set():
            break
        p = Path(line.strip())
        if p.exists():
            yield p
```

This approach gives us several advantages:
- **Speed**: Spotlight queries are lightning-fast compared to filesystem traversal
- **Rich Metadata**: Access to file usage patterns, content types, and modification dates
- **System Integration**: Leverages macOS's built-in indexing system

### Metadata Retrieval: The `mdls` Command

For each discovered file, we extract detailed metadata using the `mdls` command:

```python
def mdls_value(path: Path, name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        out = subprocess.check_output(
            ["mdls", "-raw", "-name", name, str(path)],
            stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
            text=True,
        ).strip()
        if out == "(null)":
            return None
        return out
    except Exception:
        return None

def build_file_item(path: Path) -> Optional[FileItem]:
    size_raw = mdls_value(path, "kMDItemFSSize")
    size_bytes = int(size_raw) if size_raw else path.stat().st_size
    
    last_used_raw = mdls_value(path, "kMDItemLastUsedDate")
    last_used_at = None
    if last_used_raw:
        parsed = parse_mdls_datetime(last_used_raw)
        if parsed:
            last_used_at = parsed.astimezone().replace(tzinfo=None)
    
    # Fallback to modification date if last used is unavailable
    last_modified_at = datetime.fromtimestamp(path.stat().st_mtime).replace(tzinfo=None)
    
    return FileItem(
        path=path,
        display_name=path.name,
        size_bytes=size_bytes,
        last_used_at=last_used_at,
        last_modified_at=last_modified_at,
        content_type=content_type,
        type_group=type_group,
    )
```

### Concurrency Model: Producer-Consumer Pattern

To maintain a responsive UI while scanning thousands of files, we implemented a sophisticated threading model:

```python
class ScanController:
    def _run_scan(self, config: ScanConfig) -> None:
        cutoff = datetime.now().replace(tzinfo=None) - timedelta(days=config.min_age_days)
        q: queue.Queue[Optional[Path]] = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)

        def producer() -> None:
            # Discovery thread: finds files using Spotlight
            for root in config.roots:
                for path in spotlight_discover(root, self._stop_event):
                    if should_skip(path) or is_excluded(path, config.exclude_paths):
                        continue
                    q.put(path)
            q.put(None)  # Signal completion

        def consumer() -> None:
            # Metadata thread: enriches files with usage data
            while True:
                path = q.get()
                if path is None:
                    break
                item = build_file_item(path)
                if item and self._passes_filters(item, cutoff, config):
                    self.on_result(item)
            self.on_done()

        # Start both threads
        t_prod = threading.Thread(target=producer, daemon=True)
        t_cons = threading.Thread(target=consumer, daemon=True)
        t_prod.start()
        t_cons.start()
```

This design ensures:
- **Non-blocking UI**: Scanning happens in background threads
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded queue prevents memory spikes
- **Cancellation Support**: Users can stop long-running scans
- **Real-time Updates**: Results stream in as they're discovered

## 🔒 Safety Features: Protecting Critical Files

CleanMac implements multiple layers of protection to ensure your system and important files remain safe.

One of our biggest concerns was ensuring CleanMac never accidentally deletes important system files or user data. We implemented multiple layers of protection:

### System Path Protection
```python
SAFE_SYSTEM_PREFIXES = (
    "/System", "/Library", "/Applications", 
    "/usr", "/bin", "/sbin", "/opt"
)

BUNDLE_SUFFIXES = (
    ".app", ".framework", ".photoslibrary", 
    ".aplibrary", ".appbundle", ".kext"
)

def should_skip(path: Path) -> bool:
    s = str(path)
    if s.startswith(SAFE_SYSTEM_PREFIXES):
        return True
    if any(part.endswith(BUNDLE_SUFFIXES) for part in path.parts):
        return True
    if any(part.startswith(".") for part in path.parts):  # Hidden files
        return True
    return False
```

### Photos Library Protection
We specifically hard-block any access to Photos library internals:
```python
# Never touch Photos Library internals
if ".photoslibrary" in str(path):
    return True
```

### Safe Deletion with `send2trash`
Instead of permanent deletion, we use the `send2trash` library:
```python
from send2trash import send2trash

def move_to_trash(self, paths: List[Path]) -> None:
    for path in paths:
        try:
            send2trash(str(path))
            self.last_trashed_paths.append(path)
        except Exception as e:
            # Log error but continue with other files
            print(f"Failed to trash {path}: {e}")
```

## UI/UX: Native macOS Experience

### PySide6 for Native Feel
We chose PySide6 (Qt for Python) to create a native-feeling macOS application:

```python
class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle(f"Clean Mac v{__version__}")
        self.resize(1100, 720)
        
        # Modern grouped layout with proper spacing
        filters_group = QGroupBox("Scan Filters", self)
        filters_group.setStyleSheet(
            "QGroupBox { font-weight: 600; border: 1px solid #444; "
            "border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 12px; }"
            "QGroupBox::title { subcontrol-origin: margin; left: 12px; padding: 0 6px; }"
        )
```

### Real-time Progress Updates
The UI updates in real-time as files are discovered:
```python
def _drain_results(self) -> None:
    """Drain results from background thread to UI."""
    count = 0
    while not self._result_queue.empty():
        try:
            item = self._result_queue.get_nowait()
            self._add_result_to_table(item)
            count += 1
        except queue.Empty:
            break
    
    if count > 0:
        self._found_count += count
        self.found_summary.setText(f"Found: {self._found_count}")
        self._update_selection_summary()
```

### Onboarding and Permissions
We included a comprehensive onboarding flow to guide users through permissions setup:

```python
class OnboardingDialog(QDialog):
    def _setup_first_run_content(self, layout):
        perms_text = QTextEdit()
        perms_text.setHtml("""
        <p><b>Full Disk Access</b> may be required for scanning certain directories.</p>
        <p>If you encounter permission issues:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access</li>
        <li>Add Python or Clean Mac to the list</li>
        <li>Restart the application</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Clean Mac never accesses system files or app bundles.</p>
        """)
```

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Spotlight Metadata Inconsistency

**Problem**: Not all files have `kMDItemLastUsedDate` metadata, especially older files or those from external drives.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust fallback system:
```python
# Try to get last used date from Spotlight
last_used_raw = mdls_value(path, "kMDItemLastUsedDate")
last_used_at = None

if last_used_raw:
    parsed = parse_mdls_datetime(last_used_raw)
    if parsed:
        last_used_at = parsed.astimezone().replace(tzinfo=None)

# Fallback to modification date if last used is unavailable
last_modified_at = datetime.fromtimestamp(path.stat().st_mtime).replace(tzinfo=None)

# Use the most recent date available
effective_date = last_used_at or last_modified_at
```

### Challenge 2: macOS Permissions and Full Disk Access

**Problem**: macOS requires Full Disk Access for scanning certain directories, but users often don't grant this permission initially.

**Solution**: Graceful degradation with clear user guidance:
- Detect permission issues during scanning
- Provide one-click access to System Settings
- Continue scanning accessible directories
- Show clear error messages for inaccessible paths

### Challenge 3: Performance with Large File Sets

**Problem**: Scanning directories with tens of thousands of files could freeze the UI.

**Solution**: Implemented streaming results with bounded queues:
```python
# Bounded queue prevents memory issues
q: queue.Queue[Optional[Path]] = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)

# UI updates in small batches via timer
self._drain_timer = QTimer(self)
self._drain_timer.setInterval(100)  # Update every 100ms
self._drain_timer.timeout.connect(self._drain_results)
```

### Challenge 4: App Packaging and Distribution

**Problem**: Creating a distributable `.app` bundle that works on other Macs without Python installed.

**Solution**: Comprehensive PyInstaller configuration:
```python
# CleanMac.spec
exe = EXE(
    pyz, a.scripts, a.binaries, a.zipfiles, a.datas, [],
    name=app_name,
    debug=False,
    console=False,  # No console window
    icon=str(icon_path),
)

app = BUNDLE(
    exe,
    name=f'{app_name}.app',
    bundle_identifier=f'com.cleanmac.{app_name.lower()}',
    version=app_version,
    info_plist={
        'LSMinimumSystemVersion': '12.0',
        'NSHighResolutionCapable': True,
        # ... additional macOS-specific settings
    },
)
```
